// With Account set, the load belongs to an ordinary account, and everything
// that came from outside runs as that account's own role, the one the gateway
// logs it in as: an uploaded .sql script, the dump a source server produced,
// the rows a MySQL server sent, a pipeline's models and tests. So an import can
// do on its new branch what the account could do there through the gateway, and
// nothing more. Those psql sessions also have backslash commands switched off
// (\restrict), because a psql command is not SQL and no database role limits it.
//
// What FoxByte writes itself (the schema reset before a load, CSV and JSON
// loaders, the pipeline's staging step) is unchanged and still runs as the
// superuser: none of it executes text the source supplied.
