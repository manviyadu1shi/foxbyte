// Shared state — phase 2 of docs/FOX_HA_Plan.md: accounts, API keys and the
// records authored around them reach every node, so a failover does not leave
// nobody able to sign in.
//
// The decision, recorded in §3.2 and taken again before this was written: the
// store does **not** move into `main`. internal/auth imports exactly one
// package of ours and never the engine, so signing in, verifying a key and
// appending to the security log all work while the database is down — and that
// is the window this phase exists to protect. Accounts kept inside the thing
// that fails over are accounts nobody can read during a failover.
//
// So every node keeps its own store, and the rows are carried between them over
// the channel that already exists: the WAL the standby is already streaming,
// already over TLS, already authenticated, already watched. A document of the
// carried tables (internal/auth/shared.go) is written into a database of its
// own on the primary; physical replication puts it on the other machine; that
// machine reads it from its own copy and applies it into its own SQLite. Auth
// reads never leave the local file, so the property above is kept.
//
// One writer, always. The node that is nobody's follower ships; a node that
// followsageprimary elsewhere applies. There is no merge, and there cannot be
// one: two nodes writing accounts would need consensus, which §2 of the review
// priced for a two-server shop and which this deliberately does not buy.
//
// What this is not:
//
//   - Not synchronous. The document travels in the WAL, so a failover can lose
//     the last few seconds of account changes, exactly as it can lose the last
//     few seconds of writes. An account created during the incident may not be
//     on the surviving machine.
//   - Not a merge. A node that follows has its carried tables *replaced* by
//     the document. Accounts created on a follower are overwritten, which is
//     why `user create` refuses there.
//   - Not row-level. The whole document is rewritten whenever it changes,
//     which is the right shape for the thousands of rows these tables hold and
//     the wrong one for millions. The limit is stated rather than discovered:
//     if accounts ever reach that scale this becomes a row-level log, and the
//     digest is already the seam that would need.
