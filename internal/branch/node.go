// Letting a standby on another machine reach this primary.
//
// Phase 1 of docs/FOX_HA_Plan.md. Everything the engine does today keeps
// Postgres off the network: startContainer publishes no host port, and the
// comment there says why — a direct connection would bypass the gateway, its
// API key, TLS and ledger attribution. A standby on another machine needs the
// opposite, so this is the one command that reverses it, and it reverses it
// narrowly:
//
//   - only when asked, and never by default;
//   - only on the address given, not on every interface;
//   - only over TLS, with a certificate the standby verifies (nodecerts.go);
//   - only for db_replica, which can copy the database and read none of it
//     (replicationrole.go);
//   - only from the peer address named, as a /32.
//
// Each of those five was measured across two machines before this was written.
// The one that matters most is the second-to-last: the superuser is refused
// even over TLS from the permitted address, because the rule names a role.

// nodePGCertDir holds the certificate and key the primary serves.
//
// Deliberately NOT inside main's data directory, even though that is already
// bind-mounted and would have saved a mount. pg_basebackup copies PGDATA — so
// a key kept there would be handed to every standby that joins, which is the
// opposite of what a key is for. Mounted read-only instead.
