// Keeping a running process's entitlement in step with the licence file.
//
// The entitlement used to be read once, when a process started, and that was
// fine while the only way to change a licence was a command followed by a
// restart. It stopped being fine when the console learned to activate one: the
// control plane honoured it at once and the Gateway, the Agent API and a running
// MCP session went on refusing the same features until somebody restarted them
// — so the button said "activated" and half the product disagreed. Every
// long-running process now watches the file and re-reads it when it changes.
//
// It also re-reads on a timer when nothing has changed, because a licence can
// change state without being touched: it expires, it enters its grace period,
// the grace runs out. A process that only looked at start-up would honour a
// licence for as long as it happened to stay up past the date it ended.
