// Package access decides what an account may do to a branch. It is the one
// rule every surface applies — the control plane, the Agent API, the Gateway
// and MCP — so a branch cannot be closed on one and open on another.
//
//   - An admin (a superuser or a member of db_admin on main) may do anything.
//   - The account that made a branch owns it, and may use and manage it.
//   - main is shared: every account may use it. What it may do there is what
//     Postgres lets its role do.
//   - Any other branch, including one with no owner, is not there: it is not
//     listed, and acting on it answers as if it did not exist.
